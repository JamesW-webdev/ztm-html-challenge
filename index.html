	<h1>Not pretty, but still functional!</h1>
	<p>I am James, an aspiring web developer and lifelong learner undergoing the Full Stack Web Developer career path at ZTM. This little HTML challenge is a great way for me to practice what I've just learned, although I'd rather not go beyond one page for this one!</p><br>
	<h2>My goals with this course:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Obtain the fundamental skills and know-how to use front-end and back-end languages for the web.</li>
		<li>Practice what I am learning and build up several projects to cement what I'm learning and boost my portfolio.</li>
		<li>Use what I've learned to get a career in web development (though I wouldn't mind freelancing either!)</li>
	</ol><br>
	<h2>Things that I enjoy</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Videogames (a little too much...)</li>
		<li>Tabletop roleplay (fireball EVERYTHING!)</li>
		<li>Learning new things (especially tech related!)</li>
	</ul>
	<br><br>
	<h2>But enough about me!</h2>
	<p>Tell me your goal! Anything you like! I won't know what it is since I don't have any backend coding knowledge... yet! But just get it out there, get it off your chest... err, your fingers!</p>
